# FractalEmoji
A stupid project that replaces pixels in an emoji with emojis.

The idea is to have an emoji blown up and each pixel replaced with that emoji. Expanded to allow different emojis for shading.

Not so fractal anymore, but you can use any image (not necessarily emojis) and replace the pixels with 8 different images.

Press 's' to save your image as output.png in the sketch folder.

All png files in the /data folder will be pulled into the palette. If a "data/base.png" exists it will be loaded as the base. Drag and drop into the buckets or the base image.
